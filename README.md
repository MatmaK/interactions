# Pingr project

This is a Twitter based project for microservices concepts studies.

It's composed by:
- [Connections microservice](https://github.com/MatmaK/connections)
- [Content microservice](https://github.com/MatmaK/content)
- [Pings microservice](https://github.com/MatmaK/pings)
- [Accounts microservice](https://github.com/MatmaK/accounts)

I am following this modeling to develop the project: [Pingr modeling](https://cursosextensao.usp.br/pluginfile.php/793547/mod_resource/content/1/Pingr%20-%20Event%20Storming.pdf)  

## Interactions microservice

This service controls the interactions between users and pings (posts). You can pong a ping (just like a retweet) and you can like a ping. 

In addition, it'll be possible to get how many likes and pongs a ping has.
